                    THIS PROGRAM SIMULATES A DAY IN THE LIFE OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK OF THE YEAR 2020. YOU AND YOUR HOUSEHOLD WILL GO ABOUT YOUR DAY TO ACCOMPLISHING ALL OF YOUR ERRANDS, WHILE NAVIGATING ABOUT THE CITY OF PORTLAND, OREGON --- IF YOU MAKE IT ALIVE. YOU HAVE SAVED X AMOUT OF MONEY IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT TO HELP GET YOU THROUGH (BUT DON'T WORRY. YOUR COST OF LIVING IS ADJUSTED TO YOUR JOB JUST LIKE IN 2020! WHICH MEANS, IN OUR CURRENT REALITY, THERE IS NONE. YOUR F***ED.) YOU WILL NEED TO SPEND YOUR MONEY THROUGHOUT YOUR DAY TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOALS, BUT KEEP AN EYE OUT! EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING IS A RISK THESE DAYS! YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP IN THE -$$ OR LOSING ALL YOUR HP (HEALTH POINTS), OTHERWISE YOU MAY HAVE A TOMBSTONE WAITING WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. 
                    GOOD LUCK! 
                    AND MY COMMON SENSE GUIDE YOU.
