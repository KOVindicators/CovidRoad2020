                        This program simulates a day in the life of the Covid-19 outbreak in the year 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You and your household will go about your day accomplishing all of your errands, while navigating about the city of Portland, Oregon --- if you make it alive. You have saved an allotted amount of money in your bank account to help get you through (but don't worry, your cost of living is adjusted to your job just like in 2020! Which means, in our current reality, there is none. You're F***ED.)
                        You will need to spend your money throughout your day to accomplish your goals, but keep an eye out! Everyone and everything is a risk! You don't want to end up losing all your money or hp (health points), otherwise you may have a tombstone waiting with your name on it.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        Good luck!
                        And may common sense guide you
                    </p>
