                Shawn wrote his first code on the same Apple II that he used to play Oregon Trail in seventh grade. During the 1990s he made some terrible websites but somehow even dealing with table-based layout didn't put him off of development entirely. When not coding he enjoys hiking, gardening, attending concerts, and cooking.
